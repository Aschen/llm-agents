  question: `What is a good ratio of daily active users to total users for an up and coming iOS social network app?`,
  answers: [
    `If your daily active users % is dropping as you're growing the user base, your app is in trouble.

    From the outset, during the growth phase you want more % of users to become DAU...not less. If you're growth is not showing a correlation between new sign ups and DAU growth, your new sign ups are the wrong audience/ mis-spent marketing dollars.
    
    From a growth perspective, you would want to see an increase in DAU as more members join the network due to the expanded opportunity to connect with people and information.
    
    Having said that: 1700 users isn't really a large enough sample size, especially if many of the 167 daily users are likely friends / family / employees / invested parties, which would throw off the ratio.
    
    Also, DAU isn't the only metric. If user drop off is increasing (users who sign up and only sign in 1 or 2 times) it doesn't matter if they contribute to DAU because they never come back. The ratio of 'disinterested' or 'non sticky' users (ones who don't come back) is much more important number for a fledgling app/service.
    
    Another metric would be logins per month. Even if 90% of the sign ups never return... if the users who love you network come back more often over time, that would show a success trend. You could then try to expand within the demographic (or interests groups) that find your network irresistible. `,

    `"Aspirational" benchmarks: Twitter runs at 44% DAU to MAU and Facebook at 65%.

    Mobile games have some value as a reference point - Zynga's overall portfolio which includes a fair social component is at 26%.
    
    provides some other data points which were reasonable in my view.
    
    The right ratio to model for your app will depend on what your "location based social network" offers. Something like Foursquare that a user could reasonably use everyday might be able to achieve ~40%-50% whereas a more local event or travel focused social app would have a much lower ceiling. `,

    `I assume you are asking about the Daily Active User to Monthly Active Users ratio (DAU to MAU)

    Short version: if you are a “regular”, “indie” or “startup” app, ~20% is a reasonable benchmark generically. It really depends on your use case/category (social will be higher whereas travel would be low)
    
    Mega franchises have much higher DAU to MAUs (Facebook mid 60s, Twitter and Netflix low 40s)….but they really are at a different level that makes them aspirational only in most cases.
    
    There are a number of DAU to MAU benchmarks throughout Quora (including a handful of my answers) if you need more details.
    
    Hope that helped at all.`,
